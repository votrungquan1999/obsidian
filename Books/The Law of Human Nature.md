## Chapter 7: Soften People's resistance by confirming their self-opinion (The law of Defensiveness)
- The people are living more and more isolated, they usually turn inward
- Hence people value the validations that they received 
- Put the focus to other, let them be the star, give them the validation that they wanted and they will be less defensive to any idea you are trying to persuade them
- The first move is always to step back, assume inferior position to the other. ask for their advice, â€¦ People are dying to share their wisdom and experience. 
- Once you feel they are addicted to this behavior, you can initiate cycles of favor, help them on small things. 
- Eventually, they are willing to do you favors without thinking of being manipulated
- Create the feel of validation is the key to open the defensiveness of people
- In the complex modern world, this is the important skill that every one must possess
- The laws 
	- People always have self-opinions
	- People have personalized self-opinion, to help with their insecurity
- 3 self-opinions that most people have are: 
	- I am autonomous, acting on my own will
	- I am intelligent, in my own way, at least
	- I am basically good, or decent person
- When trying to convince people, 3 things can happen:
	1. Challenge the self-opinion of that person. Even you are subtle, it can implies that you know better. The wall of self-defense will continually rise
	2. Neutral approach, neither challenge nor confirm. in this scenario, people remains resistance with your idea. however, you have better chance to persuade them using your rational argument
	3. Actively confirm their self-opinion. Fulfilling people's greatest emotional needs. The 3 self-options above can only be confirmed by other people. When you give it to people, they will be relax, their mind are open to ideas.
- Caveat: most people have strong self-opinion, some people have low self-opinion, maybe they are insecure and want to prepare themself for the worst. the same rule applies. If you insist that they can easily better their life by following your advice, this will clash with their belief
- When asking for favor, don't remind them of what we did for them, because it will remind them of the time they are weak, helpless, which make them feels resentful. Instead, remind them of what they did for you in the past, this help them confirm their self opinion of generosity and kindness
- We should have doubts about ourself, our knowledge, make it a joyful experience when we find that any new imperfect thing, that would prevent us from being stubborn, resist to good changes
## Chapter 8: The law of self sabotage

- View the way people treat you is mostly because of your attitude 
## Chapter 9: The Shadow
- People tend to have a facade to cover the shadow inside them. the ones without the facade, act all the shadow outward are criminals
- The deeper the repression of the shadow, the more volatile the shadow becomes
- One who can Integrate the shadow and the bright side would be more charming to other people since they remind us of the child part of our self that has been lost during the growing process
